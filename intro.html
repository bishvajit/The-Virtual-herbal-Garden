      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Medicinal herbs are plants valued for their therapeutic properties, flavor, or fragrance. 
        Throughout history, herbs have been used as the primary source of medicine by civilizations worldwide. 
        Ancient Egyptians documented herbal knowledge on papyrus scrolls, Chinese practitioners 
        developed Traditional Chinese Medicine with complex herb formulas, and Ayurveda in India 
        emphasized herbs as part of a holistic approach to health. These plants contain natural compounds 
        like alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenes that can positively impact health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Herbal medicine continues to be popular even in modern healthcare because it offers natural 
        alternatives or complementary options alongside pharmaceuticals. Herbal teas, tinctures, capsules, 
        and ointments are widely available and form part of preventive healthcare. Increasingly, scientific 
        studies validate many traditional herbal remedies, showing that herbs are not only folklore but 
        also potent medicinal agents.
