      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Herbal medicine has been a cornerstone of healthcare for thousands of years. Civilizations such as the Egyptians, Chinese, and Greeks cataloged and used hundreds of plants for healing. Herbal medicine focuses on prevention and balance, aiming to treat the body holistically. Many modern drugs derive from natural plant compounds — for example, aspirin from willow bark and morphine from the opium poppy.

      <p>
        Traditional medicine emphasizes the synergy between herbs, diet, and lifestyle to achieve health. Today, herbalists combine ancient knowledge with scientific research to develop safe, effective remedies. Herbal therapies are available as teas, tinctures, capsules, ointments, and essential oils.
