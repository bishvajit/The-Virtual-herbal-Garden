      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Herbal medicine isn’t just for when you’re sick—it’s a way to enhance health every day. 
        Herbs can be woven into meals, skincare, self-care rituals, and even your home environment. 
        Instead of waiting for illness, using herbs proactively can strengthen immunity, reduce stress, 
        improve sleep, and balance digestion. For example, adding rosemary and thyme to soups not only 
        enhances flavor but also offers antimicrobial benefits. Sipping chamomile tea in the evening helps 
        calm nerves, while peppermint or ginger tea aids digestion after a heavy meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the easiest ways to start integrating herbs is by cooking with them. Culinary herbs are 
        medicinal in their own right—oregano and basil are high in antioxidants, turmeric and ginger 
        reduce inflammation, and garlic supports cardiovascular health. Herbal teas and infusions are 
        another gentle daily practice. A morning cup of tulsi tea can reduce stress, while lemon balm 
        tea can calm anxiety during busy workdays.

      <h2>Good Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Supports daily wellness without needing high doses or supplements.</li>
        <li>Affordable, accessible, and easy to incorporate into meals and routines.</li>
        <li>Safe for most people, especially when using common culinary herbs.</li>
        <li>Encourages mindfulness and connection with nature.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bad Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Requires consistency; benefits are gradual, not instant.</li>
        <li>Some herbs may be unsafe for pets or children in large amounts.</li>
        <li>Overuse of essential oils can cause irritation or toxicity.</li>
        <li>May not address serious health conditions without additional support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Medicines & Cures</h2>
      <p>
        Herbs for everyday life:  
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Turmeric + Black Pepper:</strong> Anti-inflammatory; add to curries, soups, and smoothies.</li>
          <li><strong>Lemon Balm:</strong> Calming herb; great in tea or infused water for anxiety and focus.</li>
          <li><strong>Peppermint:</strong> Excellent for digestion; use as tea or in desserts.</li>
          <li><strong>Lavender:</strong> Relaxing scent for aromatherapy, pillow sprays, or baths.</li>
          <li><strong>Rosemary:</strong> Boosts memory and circulation; perfect for roasts or hair rinses.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Conditions to Use</h2>
      <p>
        Integrate herbs into daily rituals rather than waiting for illness. Use lavender oil in a diffuser 
        to wind down at night, or start mornings with ginger tea to boost energy. Replace chemical-based 
        cleaning products with vinegar infused with lemon peels and rosemary for a natural, antibacterial 
        cleaner. Add herbal baths—chamomile, calendula, or eucalyptus—for sore muscles or skin support.  
        This lifestyle approach is about balance: small, frequent doses of herbs provide gentle 
        long-term health benefits. Always research safety guidelines for pets, children, and pregnancy.
