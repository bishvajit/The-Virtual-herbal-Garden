      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Plants have been humanity’s first medicine. Long before synthetic drugs, people used 
        herbs and plants to heal wounds, reduce fever, and strengthen immunity. Today, 
        researchers know that many plants produce phytochemicals—bioactive compounds 
        that defend against diseases. Examples include alkaloids (pain relief), flavonoids 
        (antioxidants), and terpenes (anti-inflammatory).
      </p>
      <p>
        Herbal medicine works holistically, addressing the root cause of illnesses rather than 
        just symptoms. Unlike pharmaceuticals that often isolate a single compound, plants 
        offer a “synergistic” effect from multiple active ingredients. This synergy can make 
        them safer for long-term use.

        <li>Many herbs strengthen the immune system naturally.</li>
        <li>Can treat both physical and emotional well-being (adaptogens).</li>
        <li>Low toxicity for most herbs when used correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bad Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Potential contamination with heavy metals or pesticides.</li>
        <li>Lack of dosage consistency in unregulated supplements.</li>
        <li>Slow-acting for acute illnesses.</li>
        <li>Not always supported by strong clinical trials.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Medicines & Cures</h2>
      <p>
        Garlic is a natural antibiotic, ginger helps fight nausea, and echinacea supports 
        immunity. St. John’s Wort can help with mild depression. These herbs have made 
        their way into modern medicine, inspiring drugs like aspirin and morphine.
      </p>

      <h2>Conditions to Use</h2>
      <p>
        Herbs are effective for chronic inflammation, digestive issues, seasonal colds, 
        and mental health support. They are not a replacement for urgent care but are 
        excellent for preventive health and daily wellness.
