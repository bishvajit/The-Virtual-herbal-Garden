      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Harvest timing is the single most important factor in herbal potency. Leaves are best collected just before flowering when volatile oils peak; flowers should be harvested when fully open and dry; seeds are gathered when brown and mature; roots are typically dug in late autumn after energy returns underground. Harvest mid-morning after dew has evaporated but before heat disperses aromatics. Use clean, sharp scissors or pruners to prevent tearing tissue, and place cuttings in a breathable basket—not plastic—so moisture doesn’t cause wilting or microbial growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        After harvesting, process promptly. For leafy herbs, sort out damaged material and gently rinse if necessary, then pat dry thoroughly. For flowers like chamomile and calendula, spread a single layer on mesh trays to prevent clumping. Roots require scrubbing, slicing, and slower drying due to density. Label each batch with plant name, part used, date, and location—these details matter when evaluating potency later. Avoid direct sun during drying; it degrades color and constituents.

      <h2>Good Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Control over quality—clean, correctly identified plant material.</li>
        <li>Lower cost and easy access to customized blends.</li>
        <li>Ability to select ideal harvest windows for maximum potency.</li>
        <li>Hands-on knowledge of plant behavior and seasonal rhythms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bad Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Requires space and good airflow for drying setups.</li>
        <li>Risk of mold if herbs are dried too slowly or stored damp.</li>
        <li>Loss of volatile oils if exposed to heat or sunlight.</li>
        <li>Time-consuming labeling, sorting, and storage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Medicines & Cures</h2>
      <p>
        Preservation methods shape the medicine you make. 
        <strong>Air-drying</strong> preserves most leaves and flowers for teas; store in airtight jars away from light for 6–12 months. 
        <strong>Tincturing</strong> extracts constituents into alcohol or glycerin—excellent for long-term stability and fast dosing; typical ratios range from 1:2 to 1:5 (weight:volume) depending on plant part. 
        <strong>Infused oils</strong> (e.g., calendula, St. John’s Wort) are perfect for salves; infuse in a sterile, dry jar with a stable carrier like olive or jojoba for 4–6 weeks, then strain and add beeswax to thicken. 
        <strong>Freezing</strong> preserves tender leaves like basil or mint; pulse with a little water, freeze in ice trays, and pop cubes into teas or soups. 
        <strong>Syrups</strong> combine strong decoctions with honey for soothing cough formulas (thyme, licorice, ginger).
      </p>

      <h2>Conditions to Use</h2>
      <p>
        Dried teas are ideal for daily tonics—peppermint for bloating, lemon balm for nerves, nettle for minerals. Tinctures shine in acute needs where quick, concentrated dosing helps, such as echinacea at the onset of a cold or ginger for nausea. Salves and oils support skin conditions: calendula for chapped skin, comfrey (external only) for minor sprains, and aloe gel for burns. Always discard any herb showing moisture, off-odors, or visible mold. If you’re pregnant, nursing, or on medications like blood thinners, seek guidance before using concentrated extracts.
