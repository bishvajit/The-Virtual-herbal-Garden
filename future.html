      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Herbal medicine is evolving beyond traditional practices into a science-driven, technology-enhanced 
        field. Research now identifies the exact compounds responsible for healing effects, leading to 
        safer dosages, better quality control, and novel drug discoveries. Biotechnology has enabled 
        scientists to grow rare medicinal plants in labs, ensuring sustainability and preventing 
        overharvesting of endangered species. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are helping 
        predict herb-drug interactions, optimize herbal formulas, and even discover new therapeutic 
        molecules from plants. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consumer demand for natural and holistic healthcare is skyrocketing. Global herbal supplement 
        markets are expected to reach billions in revenue in the next decade. Countries are developing 
        stricter regulations for herbal medicine, ensuring safety, purity, and accurate labeling. 
        The fusion of tradition and technology promises a future where herbs are not only a wellness 
        choice but a validated part of integrative healthcare systems.

      <h2>Good Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scientific validation of traditional remedies through clinical trials.</li>
        <li>Advanced cultivation methods preserve rare species and ecosystems.</li>
        <li>AI-driven tools personalize herbal treatments for individuals.</li>
        <li>Global access to high-quality, standardized herbal supplements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bad Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Commercialization can lead to overharvesting and cultural appropriation.</li>
        <li>High cost of certified supplements may exclude low-income communities.</li>
        <li>Potential misuse of technology in genetically modifying plants.</li>
        <li>Regulations differ widely, creating confusion in global markets.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Medicines & Cures</h2>
      <p>
        The future includes hybrid products combining herbs and pharmaceuticals. For example, 
        standardized extracts like curcumin capsules or resveratrol supplements offer 
        concentrated benefits. AI-driven herbal databases will allow healthcare professionals 
        to design customized blends for chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, 
        and autoimmune disorders. Precision farming and vertical agriculture will make rare 
        medicinal herbs like saffron, ginseng, and ashwagandha widely available.
      </p>

      <h2>Conditions to Use</h2>
      <p>
        Herbal medicine will increasingly be integrated into mainstream hospitals and 
        telemedicine services. Doctors will prescribe personalized herbal formulations 
        based on genetic and lifestyle data. Traditional healers will work alongside 
        researchers to preserve indigenous knowledge, ensuring authenticity.  
        As herbal medicine modernizes, consumers must remain informed, 
        verifying product authenticity and choosing sustainable sources.
