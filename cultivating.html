      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Starting an herbal garden is one of the most satisfying ways to connect with natural medicine. Whether you have a sunny balcony, a small courtyard, or a full backyard, you can design a garden that supplies fresh leaves, flowers, roots, and seeds for teas, poultices, tinctures, and cooking. The key is to match plants to your climate, available light, and the remedies you expect to use most often. Popular beginner-friendly herbs include basil, mint, lemon balm, chamomile, rosemary, thyme, oregano, tulsi (holy basil), calendula, and aloe vera. Each of these thrives in containers, responds well to regular harvesting, and has straightforward culinary or medicinal uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by observing your light. Most Mediterranean herbs—rosemary, thyme, oregano, sage—require 6–8 hours of direct sun and excellent drainage. Moisture-loving herbs like mint and lemon balm tolerate partial shade and prefer evenly damp soil. If your space is hot and dry, use terracotta pots and add perlite or coarse sand to improve drainage; if it’s humid or rainy, elevate containers to encourage airflow and prevent fungal problems. Use a high-quality, peat-free potting mix and enrich with compost for slow-release nutrients. A monthly organic feed—such as compost tea, seaweed extract, or vermicompost—keeps plants vigorous without chemical buildup.

      <h2>Good Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fresh, potent plant material for your remedies and cooking.</li>
        <li>Control over growing conditions: organic inputs, clean water, no pesticides.</li>
        <li>Cost-effective: a single plant produces repeated harvests all season.</li>
        <li>Educational and therapeutic—gardening reduces stress and builds skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bad Parts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Requires time for watering, pruning, pest monitoring, and repotting.</li>
        <li>Seasonality limits what you can grow outdoors in cold climates.</li>
        <li>Overcrowding and poor drainage can cause disease and root rot.</li>
        <li>Inconsistent potency if plants are stressed or harvested at the wrong time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Medicines & Cures</h2>
      <p>
        Choose herbs aligned with your wellness priorities. For digestion, plant peppermint, lemon balm, fennel, and chamomile. For immune support, grow echinacea and thyme; for inflammation and joints, add turmeric (in warm climates or containers) and holy basil. For skin care, calendula and aloe vera are invaluable—calendula petals for salves and aloe gel for burns and minor irritations. Culinary powerhouses like rosemary and oregano bring antimicrobial benefits to meals. Harvest lightly but frequently to keep plants bushy: snip above a leaf node to promote branching, and collect flowers (chamomile, calendula) when fully open and dry.
      </p>

      <h2>Conditions to Use</h2>
      <p>
        Home-grown herbs fit everyday care: mild indigestion, stress, seasonal colds, and topical skin support. Use freshly made teas or simple syrups for acute issues (e.g., ginger-mint tea for nausea), and create dried blends for long-term storage. Always identify plants accurately, avoid contaminated water, and research contraindications—e.g., avoid large amounts of sage during pregnancy; be cautious with echinacea in autoimmune conditions. If you take prescription drugs, check for interactions before long-term use. With good hygiene and careful timing, a small garden can supply safe, reliable remedies across the year.
